This is a script you can use to sort out a wallpaper collection by aspect ratios, or resolutions.

A list of the features you can use follows:

- Sort a single folder, ignoring the subdirectories.
- Extract a list of resolutions or aspect ratios
- Specify a destination folder
- Specify how much to deviate from the exact result when calculating the aspect ratio. This means, how accurate
  you want the program to be when deciding when a wallpaper belongs to an specified ratio. In case you don't
  know, the ratio is calculated by dividing the width between the height.
- Keep empty folders or the images in their original location. Useful when you want a copy of the folder.

The application is able to work with subdirectories, which can or cannot be already sorted out by itself.
It does not not keep track of the files already sorted, as of 2010-04-25. Future implementation of a small
SQLite database to keep track of a small "wallpaper repository" is in the works, but nothing is promised.
